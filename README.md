# SnowFX
A snow effect system for Roblox
### Setup
Insert the rxbmx, then move the SnowFX localscript to `Game.StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts`.  From there, just open the SnowFX localscript and start configuring.
### Notices
- The defaut config was made with HDR in mind, so adjustment will most likely be needed.
- If you move your mouse fast enough, you can clip out of the effect.  This is currently mitigated by the UpdatePriority variable.
